See instructions in `bank-instructions.pdf`.

Install database :
- Download mongo db and install it
- Launch mongod service (usually done during installation)
- Run command "mongo" in a new console to check mongo db install (the command must prompt successfully)


Install project :
- The API is a node / express project, node and npm must be installed on the server
- Clone the repository
- run "npm install" in project folder
- To create first banker, in project root folder run cmd "node create_first_banker.js".
  The banker is created with username "banker" and password "banker"
- run "node server.js" to launch the program. You can access to the api on "http://localhost:3000/api/


Unfortunalty the project doesn't have client for now, you have to access api by yourself for now.

Routes are :
POST bankers : create a new banker (username / password)
POST bankersession : log as banker
POST clientsession : log as client
POST accounts : create new client (userName, userFirstName, balance)
GET accounts/:id : get account info (balance and transactions)
POST transfer : transfer money to new account (amount and target)
GET accounts : get stats about accounts
DELETE bankersession : logout banker
DELETE clientsession : logout client
